## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I mostly learned how to style forms further, along with validation via JavaScript. I had done a smaller version of this before, but this was a bit more complicated as this had several elements to manage.

### Continued development

I find that I struggle to remember how to style form elements often. With how common this seems to be I feel as though I should take some notes to refer to, as I find myself going back and having to research how to style certain elements repeatedly.
